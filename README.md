# Ask me anything!

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from 
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback).

Feel free to ask anything. Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.


### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 280 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@_stefanzweifel](https://twitter.com/_stefanzweifel) on
Twitter.


### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
